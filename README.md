Used two apis in tandem wit fetch's to generate different results based of user input. In this case a quiate from an anime quotes database and a gif is spawned using the user's input.

## Optimizations

The limitation of the Gif api makes it inable to filter if what is beign presented is actually from an anime. So in theory I could make my own gif api to ensure this or figure out a way to filter gifs based on contents (more complex)

## Lessons Learned:

Strengthened familiarity with APIs and fetching JSON and parsing it. Reinforced the Separation of Concerns.
